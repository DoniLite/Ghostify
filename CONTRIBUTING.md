# Contributing to Ghostify

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Ghostify! We welcome contributions from everyone, whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving documentation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ghostify.git
   cd ghostify
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Fill in the required values in your `.env` file.

5. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   bun run dev:server
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards (see below)

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:

   ```bash
   bun run test
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add real-time cursor tracking"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:
Notice that your pull request has to target the **develop** branch

## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Follow **Biome** rules (run `bun run lint`)
- Use **meaningful variable names** and add comments for complex logic
- Prefer **async/await** over promise chains
- Use **destructuring** where appropriate
- All services are using **DTO -> Repository -> Service** logic for data validation and CRUD operations

### React Components

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Keep components **small and focused**
- Use **TypeScript interfaces** for props
- Follow **React best practices** for performance

Example component structure:

```typescript
interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onSubmit: (data: FormData) => void;
}

export const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ 
  title, 
  onSubmit 
}) => {
  // Component logic here
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* JSX here */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### API Routes

- Use **proper HTTP status codes**
- Include **input validation** for all endpoints
- Add **error handling** with meaningful messages
- Document new endpoints in the README

Example route structure:

```typescript
app.post('/api/v1/documents', async (c) => {
  try {
    // Validation
    const body = await c.req.json();
    // ... validation logic
    
    // Business logic
    const result = await createDocument(body);
    
    return c.json({ data: result }, 201);
  } catch (error) {
    return c.json({ error: 'Failed to create document' }, 500);
  }
});
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bun run test
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for **all new features**
- Include **edge cases** and **error scenarios**
- Use **descriptive test names**
- Follow the **AAA pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert)

Example test:

```typescript
describe('DocumentService', () => {
  describe('createDocument', () => {
    it('should create a new document with valid data', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const documentData = { title: 'Test Doc', content: 'Hello' };
      
      // Act
      const result = await createDocument(documentData);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toBeDefined();
      expect(result.title).toBe('Test Doc');
    });
  });
});
```
